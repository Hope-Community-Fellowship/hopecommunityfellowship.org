## As a church family we strive to obey the Bible

* Bringing people to Jesus and __*Membership*__ in His family
* Developing them to Christlike __*Maturity*__
* Equipping them for their __*Ministry*__ in the Church
* And life Mission, in order to __*Magnify*__ God's Name

We believe this is accomplished through literal Bible interpretation, and obedience to the Word of God.

> We, for our part, proclaim him, we warn, confront, and teach everyone in all wisdom; so that we may present everyone as having reached the goal, united with the Messiah.  (Colossians 1:28  Complete Jewish Bible)
