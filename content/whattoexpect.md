## First time? We're glad to help!

Hope meets on Sunday mornings at the Kauffman's house in Addison Vermont. Most days when the weather is nice, we meet outside in the front yard. Park where you can. If the grass looks safe, go for it!

Please be sure to bring a lawn chair of some sort. If you forget for whatever reason, we do have some chairs for you to sit in, it's okay!

Services start at 10AM. We start with worship in song. The music is a mix of contemporary hims and modern day classics, but always has a clear, Bible based, message.

After music we move on to a message from Pastor Jeff Kauffman. Currently, we're working through the Old Testament book of Joshua.

## Thursday Bible Study
Bible Study starts at 6:30PM every Thursday night. We meet at the Myer's home. Their address is [1233 Satterly Road in Ferrisburgh](https://www.google.com/maps?q=1233+Satterly+Road+Satterly+Rd+Ferrisburgh+VT). Please come join us for a time of food and fellowship! We usually finish up around 7:30PM with more fellowship to folllow if you'd like!

## Mens Meeting

The men of the church meet once a month on Saturday Morning at 7AM. We meet at [2867 Mountain Road in Addison Vermont](https://www.google.com/maps?q=2867+Mountain+Road+Addison+VT)
