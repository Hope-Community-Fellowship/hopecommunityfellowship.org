## Good News - God's Plan of Salvation

Here's the best news in the world--God loves us so much that He offered Jesus on the cross to bring us back into relationship with Him. You can begin a relationship with Jesus anywhere at any time.

> Whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved. (Romans 10:13)

It has been called the ABC's of Salvation, which is very fitting because we have been called by God to have a child-like faith.

First, ADMIT you are a sinner.  Being the offspring of Adam, we are born with a sinful nature, which is demonstrated in sinful thoughts actions and attitudes.  Romans 3:23 assures us that we are not alone in this profession.

> For all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. (Romans 3:23)

Secondly, BELIEVE that Jesus died and rose again for your sins.  Romans 6:23 tells us that  "the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."  Jesus paid the price for our sin, and when we put our faith in Him and His finished work on the cross, we receive the gift of eternal life.

Finally, CONFESS Jesus as your Savior.  Romans 10:9 says

> If you confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. (Romans 10:9)

Having realized your sinfulness, placed your faith in Christ, you enter into a relationship with Jesus that will impact every area of your life as you grow with Him.
