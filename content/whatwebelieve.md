## We believe in these unchanging truths from the Bible

* The Bible is the inspired Word of God
* The Genesis account of creation in six literal days
* The sanctity of human life
* God eternally exists as Father, Son and Holy Spirit
* God loved humanity so much that He gave his Son, Jesus, virgin born, to live as a man among us and die as a sacrifice for the sin of the world, to satisfy God's righteous demand against sin.
* Jesus was raised from the dead, is alive today, and will one day return  to gather believers to live with Him forever
* Jesus is the Savior of the world, and individuals are saved through personal faith in Him
* It is the mission of the church to preach the gospel throughout the world
